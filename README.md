# Parameters License

## Overview

This repository contains the basic license text of the Parameters license. The use, modification, and distribution of this Work are governed by the **Parameters License** (see `LICENSE.md`).

The primary goal of making this Work available under the Parameters License is to allow for its review and evaluation for business assessment purposes while ensuring that the Author's (Jason Miller) rights regarding modifications, commercial branding, and business association are clearly defined and protected.

## The Parameters License

The full text of the Parameters License can be found in the [LICENSE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtparametersllc/Parameters-License/refs/heads/main/LICENSE.md) file.

### Why This License Was Created

This custom license, the "Parameters License," was created by Jason Miller to address a specific need: to share creative works for evaluation and internal assessment by other businesses or entities, while maintaining strict control over how these works are subsequently used, modified, or commercially leveraged.

Many standard open-source licenses are designed for broad sharing and modification, which is excellent for collaborative development. However, for works that are intended for initial assessment or review—where the Author wishes to retain tight control over derivatives, commercial branding, and formal business associations stemming from the work—a more tailored approach was deemed necessary.

The Parameters License aims to achieve the following:

1.  **Enable Assessment:** Allow businesses and individuals to review and evaluate the Work for internal understanding and to assess its potential applicability to their own strategies or operations.
2.  **Control Modifications:** Ensure that the Work is not altered, adapted, or built upon without the Author's explicit prior written consent. This maintains the integrity and original intent of the Work.
3.  **Prevent Unauthorized Commercial Association:** Prohibit the use of the Work in any way that suggests an endorsement, partnership, or other business relationship with the Author, or the affixing of commercial branding (logos, trademarks) to promote another entity, unless a formal, separate written agreement (a "Commercial Use Agreement") is established.
4.  **Protect Intellectual Property:** Clearly affirm the Author's ownership of the Work.

This license provides a clear framework for initial, limited use, with pathways for broader use or commercialization explicitly requiring further discussion and agreement with the Author.
